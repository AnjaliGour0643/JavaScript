When to Use Arrays. When to use Objects

JavaScript does not support associative arrays. (named indexes)
You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.

WARNING !!
If you use named indexes, JavaScript will redefine the array to an object.

After that, some array methods and properties will produce incorrect results.

Example:
const person = [];
person["firstName"] = "John";
person["lastName"] = "Doe";
person["age"] = 46;
person.length;     // Will return 0
person[0];         // Will return undefined
