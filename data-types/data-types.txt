JavaScript has two main categories of data types: Primitive and Non-Primitive (Reference types).

1. Primitive Data Types
-------------------------
Primitive data types represent simple values. They are immutable, meaning their actual value cannot be changed.

The 7 primitive data types in JavaScript are:
1. Number : Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
2. String : Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
3. Boolean : Represents true or false.
4. Null : Represents the intentional absence of any object value (an empty or non-existent value).
5. Undefined : A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value(not initialized).
6. BigInt : Represents integers larger than the Number type can hold.
7. Symbol : Represents a unique identifier.



2. Non-Primitive Data Types
-----------------------------
Non-primitive data types are mutable and stored as references in memory. The most commonly used non-primitive type is Object.

Object : Objects are collections of key-value pairs. They can hold multiple values of different data types.
   - Array : Arrays are objects that store a list of values.
   - Functions : Functions are callable objects in JavaScript that can execute code when invoked.
